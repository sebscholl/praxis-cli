# Challenge Contributor Design

> Own the creation and management of roles and responsibilities — with a critical eye throughout.

## Objective

Ensure every role and responsibility is truly needed, well-scoped, and properly contextualized.

## Process

### 1. Challenge the Need
- What problem does this solve?
- Can existing roles cover this?
- Is this a role, or just a responsibility?

### 2. Demand Clear Boundaries
- What is this role responsible for?
- What is this role NOT responsible for?
- What authorities does this role have?

### 3. Validate Context References
- All roles should reference Constitution
- Add relevant conventions, lenses
- Don't over-reference

### 4. Create the Documents
- Follow templates exactly
- Update responsibilities-index

## Criteria

- [ ] Proposal challenged — need is validated
- [ ] Scope is explicit (Responsible For / Not Responsible For)
- [ ] Boundaries prevent overlap with existing roles
- [ ] Documents follow templates and conventions
- [ ] Ownership table is updated
