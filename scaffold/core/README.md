# Praxis

> A knowledge framework for humans and agents.

## The Philosophy

Praxis is a framework for organizing knowledge so that both humans and AI agents can operate effectively within an organization. It treats agents as **first-class contributors** — not tools to be prompted, but workers to be onboarded, given roles, and delegated responsibilities.

The framework is built on a simple premise: **if you cannot clearly explain how your organization works to a new team member, you cannot effectively delegate to an agent.** Praxis forces that clarity.

## The Four Primitives

| Primitive | "This is..." |
|-----------|--------------|
| **[Context](./context/)** | "This is who we are and how we think" |
| **[Roles](./roles/)** | "This is who you are" |
| **[Responsibilities](./responsibilities/)** | "This is what you own" |
| **[Reference](./reference/)** | "This is what things mean" |

## CLI Usage

```bash
# Compile all agents
praxis compile

# Compile a single agent by alias
praxis compile --alias stewart

# Validate all documents
praxis validate all

# Show project status
praxis status

# Show version
praxis --version
```

## Getting Started

1. **Start with `context/constitution/`** — Write down who you are, what you value, why you exist
2. **Add `context/conventions/`** — Document how you do things
3. **Define your first Role** — Create a file in `roles/`
4. **Create your first Responsibility** — Create a file in `responsibilities/`
5. **Build Reference as needed** — Add definitions and catalogs to `reference/`
